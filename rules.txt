BLACKJACK RULES


Basic Play:

	First the player bets to start the round.

	Both the player and dealer are dealt two cards each, one face up and one face down for the dealer and both face up for the player.

	The player then has the option to: 
		Surrender 
			Lose half the bet, forfeit the hand. 
		Double down 
			You can only double down on your original 2 cards. 
			You can not double after a split.
			Doubles your bet, stand after receiving exactly one more card.
		Split (only when 2 of the same card are drawn, i.e. the 6 of diamonds and the 6 of hearts)
			You are dealt two more cards, one for each card in the split, and your bet is doubled. Play each hand normally.
			One hand will be completed before moving to the next.
			If aces are split only one more card may be drawn for each.
			You may only split once.

	The player then chooses whether to hit (add another card) or stay (stay with the cards they have).

	If the player has not busted (gone above 21) the hand is then compared to the dealer's (see payout for comparrison results). 

	The dealer will flip their card and automatically hit if at 16 or below.

	Payout is then determined. 


Payout:

	Winning:
		
		If the dealer busts and the player has not
			Payout is 1:1
		
		If the player has more than the dealer (not including blackjack or a bust)
			Payout is 1:1
			
		If the player wins with a natural blackjack (the original cards are a card of value ten and an ace)
			Payout is 3:2
			
		If the player wins with a natural blackjack over a 3 card blackjack
			Payout is 3:2	
		
	Tie:
		
		If the player and the dealer have the same amount the player's bet is pushed (this includes blackjack)
			Bet is returned to player
			
	Losing:
		
		If the player busts (goes above 21)
			Bet is lost

		If the player has less than the dealer
			Bet is lost
			
		If the player has a multi card 21 (more than two cards) and the dealer has a natural blackjack (card of value ten and an ace)
			Bet is lost
